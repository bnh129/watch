The amazing UIKit and uPlot js libraries are included for convenience. They are not mine.

The logger reference below is just a python logging handler.


SiteHandlers.py can be used by a tornado application as follows:

import tornado.web
import SiteHandlers as site


settings = {
        "static_path": "www/",
}

app = tornado.web.Application([
        (r"/market_history/(.*)", site.CryptoAssetHistoryRequestHandler, dict(
                                path=settings['static_path'],
                                logger=logger,
                        ),
        ),
        (r"/asset/(.*)", site.CryptoAssetsRequestHandler, dict(
                                path=settings['static_path'],
                                logger=logger,
                        ),
        ),
        (r"/watch/", site.CryptoWatchListRequestHandler, dict(
                                path=settings['static_path'],
                                logger=logger,
                        ),
        ),
], **settings)
